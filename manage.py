Djangoâ€™s command-line utility for administrative tasks.

This script is the main entry point for running management commands such as:
- runserver: start the development server
- makemigrations/migrate: manage database migrations
- createsuperuser: create an admin user
- custom commands (e.g., seed_data)

It ensures Django settings are loaded before executing the requested command.
